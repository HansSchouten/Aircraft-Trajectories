\section{Introduction}

The goal of our project is to create a standalone software application which can be used by researchers from the Air Transport \& Operations department at TU Delft for model-based optimization and visualization of aircraft noise. To achieve a good development process and a successful software product careful planning is required.

In the second chapter of this document an analysis of our program is provided by describing the context, problem and stakeholder inputs. Based on this the features needed for the product are described in a high level backlog and the steps needed to complete the project are defined in a roadmap. Here you can find the major release schedule and goals.

Chapter 3 contains a detailed release plan specifying our milestones per release. In chapter 4 a definition of 'done' is given on backlog items, sprints and releases. This will enable us to know when a feature is done and when the corresponding sprint item can be closed.
